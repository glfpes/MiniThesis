\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.

\usepackage{graphicx}




% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}

%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated

% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

	\rm
	With the rapid proliferation of camera-equipped smart devices (\it e.g. \rm smart phones, pads, gearings), visible light method as a novel way to suffice indoor positioning at mega malls or airports is appearing to be a reliable one since it provides high precision and with hardly additional peripherals excepts existing indoor LED luminaries compared with existing indoor positioning systems exploiting radio-frequencies that may defective at precision or RFID and other hardware-based approaches which needs rich deployment costs.
	\newline
	\indent
	To achieve this goal, existing methods exploits the frequency domain to convey distinct landmarks. However, this relies on conditioned controlling of several rolling shutter camera parameters such as exposure time and is strictly limited to the highest exposure frequency since a camera can only identify different blink frequencies with sufficient small intervals parting them apart.
	\newline
	\indent
	We describe our solutions that to address challenges mentioned above by exploiting a FDM coding mechanism to indicate multiple landmarks. After we determine the landmark, we can find a coarse positioning result collected from a digital map. We can introduce Angle of Arrival positioning algorithm to get a precise location as the result. Our prototype implementation demonstrate that our solution can offer an obviously promotion in the number of location landmarks compared to existing VLC based indoor positioning system under similar circumstances.

\section{Introduction}
Indoor localization have increasingly significance in modern indoors scenarios since the building cover prevents the availability of GPS satellite positioning signals. We believe that for most mega malls or large airports, a precise and user-friendly positioning system would be mightly valuable since customers or passengers can be lost in a complicated indoors environment. Besides, a mall equipped with a positioning system can deliver guided recommendation of merchandise for customers who walks near it. Location information is also required in the modern wireless sensor network based remote health monitoring systems.

As navigation and recommendation applications must rely on an indoor positioning system, We can figure out that a well designed indoor positioning system must satisfy at least four characteristics: 1)enough precise; 2)user friendly, which means user can attain the positioning results without extra active operations; 3)highly scalable, which means the system can be deployed in multi-layer skyscraper like buildings. 4)least extra hardware deployment, for you cannot prospect users to actively equip with an extra gearing that is essential for your system, and the ideal scene is the only needed equipment is barely the smart phone. However, despite the strong demand, there are no existing systems that can cover the four characteristics listed above.

RF-based indoor localization systems such as RADAR delivers restricted accuracy. Indoors positioning system that rely on hardware such as RFID tags are restricted by the inconvenience and extra cost of hardware deployment. Existing visible light positioning systems as Luxapose have good performance in accuracy and with the only aid of smart phones, but it fails in the situation that it requires user to actively taking a photo and this is obviously inconvenient for user to follow, and besides, it's supported landmarks are strictly related to the performance of camera parameters, and for its experiment platform of Lumia 1020, no more than a hundred landmarks can be identified distinctly since its encoding algorithm is heavily dependent on the exposure time of smart phone camera. In section 2, we will identify these existing indoor positioning systems and try to list their flaws at the environment of actual deployment.

In this paper, we propose a new approach that can provided all the four criteria listed above. We follow the work based on AOA algorithm and rolling shutter effect of smart phone camera proposed by the work of Luxapose, and targeting its defects on encoding mechanism that can only identifies handful landmarks and user-friendly scenarios that need users to actively taking a picture to locate themselves, we give our solutions. In order to make the landmarks that are distinguishable to be scalable, we raised an encoding algorithm based on the idea of frequency domain multiplexing(FDM) by mixing the RGB channels of LEDs to convey adequate messages with a blink frequency of 4000 Hz. We applied manchester codes to our encoding mechanism so that the mixed LED light will be white to human eyes. Users can taking the picture at a high exposure time and low ISO value to exploit the rolling shutter effect, and the stripes on the picture can be processed by FFT knowing its frequency is 4000 Hz, then the mixed of RGB can be detached at Hue-Saturation-Lightness (HSL) space so that we can obtain its encoding message. With the aid of web-based indoor maps, we can locate the user at a relatively close aera. If the user needs centimeter level precision, he/she can take a picture with multiple(no less than three) landmarks(led luminaries) and with the aid of AOA algorithm, the system can provide the result. We propose a scenario that users can obtain similar map experience indoors as outdoors that based on GPS module. In this scenario, we exploit the smart phone 3D acceleration sensor and compass sensor, we can obtain the user's track by software and with history based learning strategy we can remind users to adjust their location by our visible light positioning system to erase the deviation. So in this scenario, the indoor malls need to add a control module to the rgbleds, and the users need to install the smart phone app to work with the server, and all together we can fulfill this indoor positioning scenario.
	
\section{Background and Motivation}
Instantly knowing the location indoors is feasible in several related works. Specifically, there are two types of them: signal based IPS(indoor positioning system) and visible light based IPS. Signal based IPS, includes ultrasonic(US) and infrared(IR), and radio-frequency(RF) signal which may based on radio-frequency identification (RFID), received signal strength (RSS) of RF signals, Bluetooth wireless local area network (WLAN), ultra-wideband (UWB), etc[7]. Visible light based IPS usually exploits visible light with computer vision to work together as a method in IPS. It works with embeded CMOS cameras in smart phones which needs hardly additional facilities and provides fine results.
	
	\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{../img.origin/fig1.pdf}
	\caption{Architecture of general IPS.}
	\label{fig_sim}
	\end{figure}

An indoor positioning system generally has an architecture of 3 phrases as shown in Figure 1. First step is to expose physical signals that contains the location information by US, IR, RF or other signals described above. These signal travels between emitter and receiver token by users. Then various methods are applied to calculate the physical quantity like measuring time of flight(TOF), time of arrival (TOA), time different of arrival (TDOA), angle of arrival (AOA), received signal strength (RSS) etc. With the raw information of a physical quantity measured, various techniques and algorithms are used which transform raw data into usable position information. Techniques have been classified as triangulation/trilateration [9], minmax algorithm [10], maximum likelihood[11] and fingerprinting [12].


RF systems estimate user location by measuring different properties of RF signals. RF Received Signal Strength Information (RSSI) has been employed for many different location estimation systems [13]. Performance of RSSI based location systems is highly effected by errors in signal strength resulted from multipath fading, reflection shadowing, diffraction etc [7]. Most of RSSI based IPS are exploiting WLAN as the media for physical signal since its low cost and convenience such as RADAR [2]. It uses signal strength information gathered at multiple receiver
locations to triangulate the user’s coordinates. Triangulation is done using both empirically-determined and theoretically computed signal strength information. Because the drawbacks mentioned above on WLAN's multipath effect or so, it can only reach an estimation accuracy of 10 meters.

Ultrasonic based IPS provide fine-grained location with centimeter level accuracy and it have higher capacity of location to serve many users simultaneously. As the work of Cricket[5], it relies on TOF measurement of US signal calculated using velocity of sound and other signal combined such as RF signal. But unlike RF signals, velocity of sound in air does not remain constant and varies largely with environmental condition especially humidity and temperature [7]. For example, the speed of sound is:
	\begin{equation}
	v_{us} = 20.05 \sqrt{T} 
	\end{equation}
Which means for each kelvin at normal indoor environment, the deviation is close to 0.18\%, an untolerated error. Another challenge to US systems is offered by high levels of environmental US noise. If noise is non-persistent, erroneous location estimates are filtered by use of suitable algorithms but persistent noise sources degrade system performance. Despite these challenges. deploying a US based IPS means a lot more hardware deployment work is to be done, and the users must be equipped with US receiver to get the system worked. This inconvenience can not be ignored in large-scale popularization.

RFID as a widely applicated low-cost hardware is also been developed as an method in IPS. Compared as RF and US signals, all RF tags can be read despite extreme environmental factors, such as snow, fog, ice, paint, and other visually and environmentally challenging conditions with a remarkable reading speed of less than 100 milliseconds. LANDMARC [8] is a RFID based IPS. It develops an algorithm to reflect the relations of signal strengths by power levels and maps which power level corresponds to what distance with the method of TDOA, and it reached a result of 2 meter level deviation. However it also have some problems. Currently available RFID products provides the signal strength of tags directly. Instead, the reader reports “detectable” or “not detectable” in a given range. This forces LANDMARC to spend approximately one minute each time to scan the 8 discrete power levels and to estimate the signal strength of tags which means the cost is unignorable. Besides, to apply this IPS, the mall needs to deploy several RFID tags and one RFID reader at an office-size area.

Apart from signal based IPS, there are works that relies on visible light to deliver the physical location information. Visible light are free of multipath, shadowing or attenuation of wireless signals, and are free from the influences of environmental temperature and moisture. 
One visible light based IPS, Epsilon [6], uses LED beacons and a custom light sensor that plugs into a smartphone’s audio port, and sometimes requires users to perform gestures. The LEDs transmit data using BFSK and avoid persistent collisions by random channel hopping. The system offers half-meter accuracy. This system requires custom hardware on user's phone and the performance can be improved.
Luxapose [1] is another visible light based IPS which relies on the LED luminaries deployed on ceilings to deliver physical location information and exploits CMOS smart phone camera to do some image processing work to get the physical signals, and by AOA algorithm it estimates the location with an accuracy of several centimeters. However in this work, each LED luminary exploits blink frequency to transmit raw message, and exploit CMOS camera's rolling shutter effect to receive these raw message in token pictures, which means the camera on smart phones must support sufficient wide range of exposure time to receive distinct LED signal. In its FFT method of decode the rolling shutter image into encoded frequency and the experiment platform of Lumia 1020 camera, it can only support about 20 distinct led beacons with the exposure frequency of camera up to 16000 Hz and the necessarily barrier between distinct LED signals of 500 Hz, and this problem is crucial in deploying this IPS in practical indoor malls or airports. Another issue is that for each time the user want to track himself/herself, he/she must take out the phone and shoot a picture of the LED luminaries on the ceilings. Obviously for each time, locating oneself needs to take a picture is not a good kind of user experience and many applications based on the track of people such as automatically merchant recommendation can not be implemented under this IPS. 

Table 1 is the benchmark comparison between the 5 IPS mentioned above.

\section{System Architecture}
This system consists of RGBLED based visible light beacons, smartphone with camera and a processing server as shown in Fig 2.

	\end{figure}

We suppose an idea named \textbf{beacon source} as shown in the architecture Fig 2 of positioning beacon source 1 and positioning beacon source 2. In an indoor digital map, one distinct beacon source stands for one location coordinate on this map, and this coordinate is encoded in the light so if we can decode it we can roughly get our position nearby this coordinate. For each beacon source, the encoding data is provided by the controlling module which actually controls the flashing mechanism of each RGBLED bulb and we implemented it based on ArduinoDue board. In reality world, we can expolit the existing densely distributed RGBLED luminaries on ceilings of mall with only a low-cost PCB controller attached to its power supply to deploy our positioning hardware.

For each beacon source, it consists of no less than three RGBLED luminaries to support the angle-of-arrival algorithm. With knowing the roughly location with the help of beacon source and digital map, we can apply AoA algorithm so that we can calculate a relatively precise location of the user. 

For each time the user wants to locate himself/herself, it is necessary to take a picture and post it to the remote server and get the location. Clearly it is not convenient. So we developed an extended smartphone application which works with 3D accelerator sensor and compass sensor which can roughly track the user's locus. The accumulated error can be erased by taking an RGBLED positioning action.
	

\section{Basic Design}
Our system adpots an RGB mixed visible light as a communication channel to deliver locationing data. The RGBLED luminaries work as the transmitter and the smartphone camera works as the receiver. The encoding section describes how we encode digital map information into light signal with red, green and blue subchannels. The decoding section describes how we recover the message from mixed visible light. The positioning algorithm gives out detailed equations of angle of arrival that how can we measure the location based on all kinds of data we get.

\subsection{Encoding}
We deploy five RGBLED luminaries with their relative geometry known to provide redundancy in case some of them cannot be decoded. In fact under ideal circumstances three RGBLED luminaries will make the system locate the user's 3D location [14].
